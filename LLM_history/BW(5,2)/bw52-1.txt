Consistency for guard parenthesis usage is required by LTS syntax.\n  - Referenced Grammar Example ID: 14\n  - Referenced Grammar Rule ID: LTS_5\n\n- Also, removed the extra space inside 'forall [id:Team]' so it becomes `forall[id:Team]`, in line with style from grammar examples.\n  - Referenced Grammar Example ID: 4\n  - Referenced Grammar Rule ID: LTS_6\n\n- No other syntax/grammar issues found for this context."
