The correct list separator for LTS process definitions is a period (.) at the end of the process chain, not a comma. The comma was left in place, but the error may also be related to a misplaced parenthesis or missing closing square bracket.\n- In fact, the actual grammatical issue referenced by the error message \"ERROR line:10 - ] expected\" occurs in:\n  - `Pending[s:Step] = ( assign[ID] -> Assigned[s] ),`\n    - There is no error here.\n  - After close inspection, the LTS block does not seem to have a bracket or syntax issue, so the error might relate to superfluous or misplaced bracket in another block, or (more likely in your context) the use of spaces after 'forall' and inside brackets. In the FLTL/LTS syntax, the correct:\n    - `forall[i:Team] Team[i]` (no spaces inside the brackets or square brackets).\n    - So, all instances of square bracket quantification should not have extra spaces.\n- Corrections:\n  - Changed `forall [id:Team] Team[id]` → `forall[id:Team] Team[id]` throughout the model.\n  - Similarly for all controller usages with `forall [id:Team]` → `forall[id:Team]`.\n- Referenced Grammar Example ID: No specific reference (correctness depends on syntax expectations for quantifier spacing and square bracket usage).  \n- Referenced Grammar Rule ID: No specific reference directly, general syntax matching with FLTL_Supervisor_Model and model examples."

In your model, after the series of process definitions for `Team[ID:Team]`, you should end the block with a period (as in example corrections). \n- Therefore, I placed a period at the end of the full list of process definitions related to `Team`.\n- Referenced Grammar Example ID: 7, 8 (for period at end of process definition), and Grammar Rule ID: LTS_1, LTS_2.\n- No other explicit bracket or punctuation issues as indicated by the error message.
